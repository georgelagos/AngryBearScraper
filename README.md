# Angry Bear Scraper
Content Scraper for Emulation Station on Raspberry Pie

Summary: The AngryBearScraper is used for gathering game metadata for the Emulation Station front-end on RaspberryPi. 
The script creates the gamelist.xml file required for Emulation Station. It downloads both the box art,
and game description from thegamesdb.com. This is an improvement on the ES-scraper.py that comes
with Emulation Station.

Usage:

python angryBear.py


Notes:

-As of this writing the scraper only supports a few game platforms.
